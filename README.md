# Power-BI-project
The project gathers data from multiple sources to track total bookings, cancellations, no-shows, and check-outs for a defined period.
Performance indicators such as average rating, occupancy percentage, and booking percentage by platform and room class are calculated to gauge customer satisfaction and demand.
Key financial metrics like revenue, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) are analyzed to evaluate profitability.
The project includes visualizations that compare current and past performance with WoW (Week-over-Week) changes to assess growth or areas of concern.
Insights are delivered in an interactive Power BI dashboard, allowing users to explore the data and make data-driven decisions for operational improvement.
